###Brief

Our cohort has been split into groups and each assigned a two week project of our
preference to complete and present on
Friday 30th January. Our team consists of: [Ed
Byne](https://github.com/ejbyne), [Ming Chan](https://github.com/ming-chan),
[Mishal Islam](https://github.com/mishal1) and [Nick
Dyer](https://github.com/nickbdyer).

Technologies are not specified within the brief - they must be decided upon by
the teams based on the merits of
each technology for the project.

###Development Stages

Our team started with an original concept of a 'Mobile Tour App', designed to
assist people who are new to a city, to find and discover information about
nearby points of interest. 

Subsequent SCRUMS and consultations with coaches revealed that the initial
concept was flawed. A combination of pre-existing apps in the market, together
with an unclear client base and a lack of content without reliance on the
Wikipedia API, brought us to a decision to pivot.

It occurred to us that one of the hardest thing to get right in a new city, is
truly getting involved in the local culture, and avoid the tourist hotspots.
Eat where the locals eat, rather than where the tourists typically end up. This
idea led us to the idea of determining whether a venue was popular or not.
